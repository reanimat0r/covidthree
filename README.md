# Covid 3 Weeks

![COVID-19](https://i.imgur.com/3FgQeIu.png)

Experts say that it could take up to the three weeks before we see the effects of our actions in reducing hospitalizations and deaths. We're worried that our elected officials aren't thinking ahead.

Note that this is intended as a rough estimate of the consequences of doing nothing, not an expert forecast. There are many reasons that our numbers could be incorrect, including the data itself -- many cases are going undetected right now, which means the total cases reported are too low and the death rate may be overestimated. 

Calculations are based on a five day doubling time and a 1.3% average population death rate for the US.
